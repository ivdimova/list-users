## User Integration Plugin
This plugin integrates user information from external API. The data can be used as a custom block, called List users.
There is an admin page, List Users, where a data preview can be seen and refreshed.
The data from the API is stored as transient, but can be also refreshed with a `wp cli` command - `wp users-api-sync sync_users `
